# Pole Position | F1 blog

## What is it?

Pole Position is an F1 blog for the F1 geeks among us. It was made as bachelor thesis for my education as a web developer/designer at KdG hogeschool. You can check out the full design in my [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/B5C0sivIm8bzzrRZAc0R0m/F1-Bachelor?node-id=0%3A1)

## What is it made of?

It is made with React + Typescript and Sass. The goal is to have some backend as well in the future to provide content for this frontend framework. 

## Got some feedback?
